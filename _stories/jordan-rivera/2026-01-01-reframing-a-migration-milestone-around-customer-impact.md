excerpt: Completing a migration milestone exposed a gap between technical progress and customer impact, prompting a shift in how success was defined.
---

As part of the cloud migration, the team reached a milestone they had been working toward for months. A major component was successfully moved, performance benchmarks were met, and the work aligned with everything that had been defined upfront.

By internal measures, it was a success.

What followed was quieter. Customer behavior didn’t change in the ways the team expected. Support volume stayed flat, and some of the friction the migration was meant to address was still present. The milestone had reduced technical risk, but it hadn’t yet changed the customer experience.

At first, this was easy to rationalize. The work was foundational. Benefits would come later. Not every improvement shows up immediately. All of that was true — but it didn’t fully explain the gap the team was noticing between progress and impact.

Instead of moving directly to the next milestone, the team paused to revisit the outcome they were actually trying to create. They looked at customer feedback, usage patterns, and recent support conversations to understand what had meaningfully changed and what hadn’t.

What emerged was a clearer picture of where the migration mattered to customers — and where it didn’t, at least not yet. Some improvements the team assumed would be felt immediately were effectively invisible. Other, smaller changes produced disproportionate impact.

This reframing was uncomfortable. The original plan was coherent, and changing it introduced new coordination challenges. Dependencies were already in motion, and revisiting priorities meant reopening decisions that felt settled.

Still, the team chose to shift. Success was no longer defined primarily by completing migration steps, but by whether those steps moved customer-relevant outcomes. Some work was deprioritized. Other work moved earlier. The sequence changed, even though the destination remained the same.

**Insight:** reframing success around customer impact prevented the migration from becoming a purely technical exercise. Investment shifted toward changes customers could actually feel, decision-making became easier to justify, and progress became clearer to leadership — distinguishing real impact from procedural completion as the transformation continued.
