### What is this practice?

Cross-team alignment rituals are lightweight, recurring coordination moments that bring teams together to surface dependencies, risks, and decisions that affect one another.

They are not status meetings; they exist to reduce surprise, clarify ownership, and enable timely decisions across boundaries.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

Cloud migration work spans platforms, services, security, and operations. When coordination is ad hoc, teams discover dependencies too late and progress stalls.

This practice supports the transformation by creating a steady rhythm for surfacing tension early, negotiating tradeoffs, and maintaining coherence across teams.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When this practice is working well, dependencies are visible early, escalation is rare, and teams can make tradeoffs without drama. Ownership is clearer, and work moves with fewer surprise blocks.

Over time, the organization develops a shared cadence for alignment that reduces friction without centralizing control.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include turning alignment into reporting, inviting the wrong people (or too many), avoiding real decisions, or using the forum to push commitments rather than surface constraints.

Teams may also lack a shared language for dependencies, making the ritual feel like noise instead of coordination.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin with a short, time-boxed weekly or biweekly alignment focused on three questions: what changed, what is blocked, and what decision is needed.

Starting with a small set of interdependent teams and keeping the ritual oriented toward decisions and dependencies helps it stay useful.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of cross-team alignment rituals in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
