excerpt: Treating decisions as testable assumptions and running small experiments to reduce uncertainty before scaling bets.

### What is this practice?

Hypothesis-driven experimentation is the practice of stating assumptions explicitly and running small experiments to learn whether those assumptions hold.

It treats decisions as hypotheses that can be tested and refined, rather than certainty that must be defended.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

Cloud migration changes constraints and unlocks new possibilities. Without experimentation, teams may scale bets based on speculation or internal preference.

This practice supports the transformation by reducing the cost of being wrong, increasing learning speed, and helping teams choose what to scale based on evidence.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When this practice is working well, teams articulate clear hypotheses, run time-boxed experiments, and capture what was learned. Decisions shift based on evidence, and large investments are preceded by smaller learning steps.

Over time, experimentation becomes a normal way to navigate uncertainty rather than an exceptional event.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include confusing experiments with launches, choosing metrics that don’t reflect learning, organizational intolerance for ambiguity, and experiments that are too large to fail safely.

Teams may also run experiments but ignore the results when they conflict with preexisting commitments.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin by selecting one assumption behind a plan and designing a small test that can be run quickly—sometimes with prototypes, limited rollouts, or analysis of existing data.

Starting with low-risk hypotheses and making the learning visible builds confidence and improves the quality of future bets.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of hypothesis-driven experimentation in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
