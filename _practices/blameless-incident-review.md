### What is this practice?

A blameless incident review is a structured reflection after an incident that focuses on understanding what happened, why it made sense at the time, and what the system revealed.

The goal is learning and improvement—capturing insights about system behavior, coordination, and assumptions—rather than assigning personal fault.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

Cloud migration increases change frequency and system complexity. Incidents and surprises are inevitable; what matters is whether the organization learns quickly and reduces repeat risk.

Blameless reviews support the transformation by strengthening trust, improving shared understanding, and turning failures into inputs for better systems and practices.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When this practice is working well, incident reviews feel safe and useful. Participants can speak honestly about decisions and constraints, and the group leaves with clearer understanding of system factors and realistic improvements.

Over time, recurring patterns are identified earlier, and both technical and coordination changes reduce the likelihood or impact of similar incidents.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include a blame-oriented culture, pressure to produce a single “root cause,” lack of follow-through on improvements, and reviews that exclude key perspectives.

Teams may also rush to solutions without first building a shared narrative of what happened and why it was reasonable in context.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin by adopting a simple review format: build a shared timeline, identify contributing factors, and capture a small set of improvements that are actionable and owned.

Starting with one recent incident and focusing on learning over judgment helps establish trust and sets a precedent for how failure will be treated.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of blameless incident review in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
