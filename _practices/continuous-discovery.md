### What is this practice?

Continuous discovery is the practice of learning about customer needs, constraints, and behaviors as an ongoing activity, not a one-time phase.

It keeps problem understanding fresh and allows teams to adjust direction as new information arrives.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

As cloud capabilities expand, teams gain new options—but also new risks and tradeoffs. Without steady discovery, teams can optimize delivery while missing what customers actually need.

This practice supports the transformation by ensuring that faster shipping is paired with faster learning, so direction improves as capacity increases.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When continuous discovery is working well, teams regularly engage with customers or customer signals, refine problem understanding, and use what they learn to influence priorities.

Delivery and discovery reinforce each other: what is shipped generates learning, and learning shapes what is shipped next.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include separating discovery into a specialized role, treating discovery as a gate before “real work,” lack of access to customers, and conflating stakeholder opinions with customer learning.

Teams may also gather information but fail to translate it into decisions and tradeoffs.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin by establishing a lightweight cadence for discovery: a recurring customer conversation, a review of support tickets, or a regular look at behavioral data.

Starting small, capturing what was learned, and explicitly noting how it influenced decisions helps make discovery durable.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of continuous discovery in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
