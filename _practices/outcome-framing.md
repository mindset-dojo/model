excerpt: Framing work around the change we want to create, so priorities are guided by impact rather than activity alone.

### What is this practice?

Outcome framing is the practice of describing work in terms of the change we want to create—what should be different for customers, users, or the business—rather than only describing the outputs we plan to produce.

It turns “what are we building?” into “what are we trying to accomplish, and how will we know?”

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

Cloud migration can create a lot of motion: replatforming, refactoring, new tooling, and new capabilities. Without outcome framing, teams can ship a great deal while staying unclear about impact.

This practice supports the transformation by aligning work to measurable change and helping teams make tradeoffs when capacity is constrained.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When outcome framing is working well, teams can explain why work matters and what signal would indicate progress. Stakeholders can discuss tradeoffs using shared language about impact, not just scope.

Over time, priorities become clearer and work feels less like a queue and more like a sequence of intentional bets.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include output-focused planning habits, lack of access to customer signals, incentives that reward shipping volume, and pressure to promise certainty before learning.

Teams may also write outcomes that are too vague to guide decisions, or too rigid to adapt as learning emerges.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin by taking one initiative and rewriting it as an outcome statement: what will be different, for whom, and how will we notice?

Starting with a small set of outcomes and revisiting them regularly as learning arrives helps teams build the muscle without needing a full overhaul.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of outcome framing in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
