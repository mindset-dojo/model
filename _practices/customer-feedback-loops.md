### What is this practice?

Customer feedback loops are the practices that bring customer signals into decision-making on a regular basis.

They can include direct conversations, support insights, usage patterns, and other signals that help teams understand whether work is creating value.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

During cloud migration, teams may focus heavily on internal work and technical milestones. Without feedback loops, it’s easy to lose sight of customer impact.

This practice supports the transformation by keeping customer value and learning connected to delivery, even when work is complex and inward-facing.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When feedback loops are working well, teams regularly review customer signals, can articulate what they are learning, and use that learning to adjust priorities.

Over time, decisions feel less opinion-driven and more grounded in what customers actually experience.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include treating feedback as anecdote, collecting signals without acting on them, lacking clear ownership for customer learning, and confusing stakeholder requests with customer needs.

Teams may also chase every piece of feedback rather than using signals to inform coherent priorities.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often begin by choosing one consistent source of customer signal (support tickets, a recurring customer interview, or a small set of usage metrics) and reviewing it on a steady cadence.

Starting with a simple question—“what are we learning, and what decision does it affect?”—helps turn feedback into action.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of customer feedback loops in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
