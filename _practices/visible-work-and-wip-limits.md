### What is this practice?

Visible work and WIP limits means making work-in-progress explicit—so teams can see what is being worked on—and limiting how much is in flight at once.

The intent is to reduce overload, surface bottlenecks, and create shared awareness that supports coordination.

---

### Why does this matter in this transformation?

Cloud migration creates many parallel streams of work. When too much is in flight, teams lose focus, coordination breaks down, and delays multiply.

This practice supports the transformation by improving flow and making constraints visible so teams can adjust priorities and dependencies in real time.

---

### What does “good” look like?

When this practice is working well, teams can quickly answer what is in progress and what is blocked. Work moves more smoothly, and bottlenecks become discussion points rather than hidden frustrations.

WIP limits create space to finish work, reduce context switching, and improve predictability without forcing false certainty.

---

### What gets in the way?

Common challenges include treating visibility as surveillance, setting WIP limits without agreement, and failing to address systemic bottlenecks that limits reveal.

Teams may also mistake a board for the practice; the practice is the conversation and the discipline of limiting work, not the tool itself.

---

### How might someone begin?

Teams often start by making current work visible in one place and agreeing on a simple limit for a key stage (for example, how many items can be actively worked at once).

Beginning with one team or one workflow stage and learning what the limits reveal can build confidence before expanding the practice.

### Explore deeper with your AI assistant

Use your AI assistant to reason through this practice in your own context.

**Prompt:**

I’m exploring the practice of visible work and wip limits in the context of a cloud migration and broader organizational change.

Help me reason through this practice by:

- explaining it in plain language without assuming specific tools or frameworks
- highlighting the tradeoffs and tensions it introduces
- describing what “good” tends to look like in real teams
- calling out common failure modes or misunderstandings
- suggesting small, low-risk ways teams often begin experimenting
- articulating who are the vendor-neutral thought leaders in the space

Please keep the discussion exploratory and context-aware rather than prescriptive.
