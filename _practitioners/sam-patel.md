  I tend to notice where work gets stuck between teams, even when everyone is busy and well-intentioned.

  As the migration has unfolded, I’ve been working on making dependencies and tradeoffs more visible, so coordination doesn’t rely on memory or goodwill alone.

  I keep learning that most friction isn’t caused by disagreement, but by things we can’t see yet.

  I’m interested in practices that help groups align without needing constant escalation.
