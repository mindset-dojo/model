  I pay attention to how risk accumulates when systems change faster than habits do.

  During the cloud migration, I’ve been working on integration practices that make problems show up sooner, when they’re easier to understand and recover from.

  I keep learning that reliability isn’t about control — it’s about making change small enough that people trust what happens when things go wrong.

  I’m interested in practices that let teams move quickly without needing heroics to stay safe.
