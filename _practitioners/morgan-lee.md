about: |
  I pay attention to how practices interact over time, especially when change stretches across teams and roles.

  In this transformation, I’ve been focused on helping people reflect on what’s emerging, not just what was planned.

  What I keep learning is that coherence doesn’t come from alignment meetings — it comes from shared language and lived experience.

  I’m interested in stewarding spaces where learning can continue even as responsibility grows.
