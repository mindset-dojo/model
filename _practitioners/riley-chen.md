about: |
  I’m interested in what systems actually do once they’re in use, not just what we expect them to do.

  During the cloud migration, I’ve been working on ways to learn from real behavior without exposing customers or teams to unnecessary risk.

  I keep learning that the safest way to change a system is often to observe it more carefully.

  I’m drawn to practices that make learning possible in production, without turning every change into a bet.
