  I focus on the gap between what we ship and what actually changes for customers.

  In this transformation, I’ve been helping teams slow down just enough to ask what outcome they’re trying to create — especially when delivery pressure makes that uncomfortable.

  What I keep noticing is how often assumptions survive simply because no one has space to question them.

  I’m drawn to practices that keep learning connected to delivery, even when plans are already in motion.
