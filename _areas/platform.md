excerpt: How decisions connect work to customer value using learning and feedback to guide outcomes that matter.
---

Product thinking is grounded in connecting work to value — deciding what to build and why, based on learning rather than assumption.

Across different approaches, this area consistently emphasizes a small set of core principles:

- Outcomes over output  
- Customer understanding over internal convenience  
- Learning over certainty  
- Feedback over speculation  

In the context of the cloud migration, these principles help ensure that faster delivery and new capabilities translate into meaningful impact. They shape how problems are framed, how options are explored, and how feedback informs priorities.

When this transformation is working, Product practices help teams focus effort on what actually matters, not just what is easiest to ship.
