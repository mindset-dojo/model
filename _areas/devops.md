excerpt: How delivery, reliability, and operations come together so change can happen safely, frequently, and with clear ownership.
---

DevOps is grounded in the integration of development, operations, and reliability as a single system of responsibility.

This area is commonly expressed through three core principles, often referred to as *The Three Ways*:

- **Flow** — enabling fast, smooth movement from idea to running system  
- **Feedback** — creating rapid feedback from systems and users to inform decisions  
- **Continuous Learning** — learning from both success and failure to improve over time  

In the context of the cloud migration, these principles shape how frequently systems can change, how safely that change happens, and how clearly ownership is held when things go wrong.

When this transformation is working, DevOps practices make change routine, failure informative, and responsibility shared rather than fragmented.
