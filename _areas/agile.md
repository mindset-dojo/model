excerpt: How teams plan, adapt, and coordinate work when learning matters more than prediction.
---

Agile is grounded in the idea that when change is constant, learning must guide how work is planned and coordinated.

The Agile Manifesto captures this through four core value tensions:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working solutions over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

In the context of the cloud migration, these principles shape how teams adapt as systems, dependencies, and constraints evolve. They emphasize visibility, feedback, and adjustment over enforcing certainty where it doesn’t exist.

When this transformation is working, Agile practices help teams learn their way forward while staying aligned across boundaries.
